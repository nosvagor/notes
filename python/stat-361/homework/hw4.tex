  \item \textbf{4.35} The random variable X, representing the number of
    errors per 100 lines of software code, has the following probability
    distribution:

    \begin{table}[h]
      \centering
      \begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}
        x &  2 & 3 & 4  & 5 & 6 \\
        \midrule
        \(f(x)\)  & 0.01 & 0.25 &0.4 & 0.3 & 0.04 \\
      \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

    Using Theorem 4.2 \(\BB{(\sigma^2 = E(X^2) - \mu^2) }\), find the
    variance of \(X\).
    \begin{align*}
      \mu &= \sum_{x=2}^{6} xf(x) = 4.11, \quad
      E(X^2) = \sum_{x=2}^{6} x^2 f(x) = 17.63 \\
      \then \sigma^2 &= 17.63 - 4.11^2 = \boxed{0.738}
    \end{align*}

  \item \textbf{4.36} Suppose that the probabilities are \(0.4, 0.3, 0.2,
    ~\text{and}~ 0.1\), respectively, that \(0, 1, 2, ~\text{or}~ 3\) power
    failures will strike a certain subdivision in any given year.

    Find the mean and variance of the random variable \(X\) representing the
    number of power failures striking this subdivision.
    \begin{align*}
      x &= [0,1,2,3], \quad f(x) = [0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1] \\
      \mu &= \sum_{x=0}^{3} xf(x) = \boxed{1}, \quad
      E(X^2) = \sum_{x=0}^{3} x^2 f(x) = 2 \\
      \then \sigma^2 &= 2 - 1 = \boxed{1}
    \end{align*}

  \item \textbf{4.37} A dealerâ€™s profit, in units of \$5000, on a new
    automobile is a random variable \(X\) having the density function

      \begin{cases}
        2(1-x),			& 0 < x < 1, \\
        0, & \text{else}
      \end{cases}
    \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    Find the variance of \(X\).
    \begin{align*}
      \mu &= \int_{0}^{1} 2x(1-x)\, dx = \frac{1}{3} \\
      E(X^2) &= \int_{0}^{1} 2x^2(1-x)\, dx = \frac{1}{6} \\
      \sigma^2 &= \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{18}
      \then \var(X) = \boxed{\frac{5000}{18}^2}
    \end{align*}

      \end{cases}
    \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    Find the variance of \(X\).
    \begin{align*}
      \mu &= \int_{0}^{1} \frac{2x(x+2)}{5}\, dx = \frac{8}{15}\\
      E(X^2) &= \int_{0}^{1} \frac{2x^2(x+2)}{5}\, dx = \frac{11}{30}\\
      \sigma^2 &= \frac{11}{30} - \left(\frac{8}{15}\right)^2 = \boxed{0.082}

    \begin{align*}
      \mu_Y &= E(3X - 2 ) =
      \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4}(3x - 2)e^{-\frac{x}{4}}\, dx = 10 \\
      E(Y^2) &= \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4}(3x - 2)^2e^{-\frac{x}{4}}\, dx = 244 \\
      \sigma_Y^2 &= 244 - 10^2 = \boxed{144}
    \end{align*}

  \item \textbf{4.50} For a laboratory assignment, if the equipment is working,
    the density function of the observed outcome \(X\) is
    \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      f(x) =
      \begin{cases}
        2(1-x), & 0 < x < 1, \\

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=4em]

  \item \textbf{8.4} The number of tickets issued for traffic violations by 8 state troopers
    during the Memorial Day weekend are 5, 4, 7, 7, 6, 3, 8, and 6.
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item If these values represent the number of tickets is- sued by a
        random sample of 8 state troopers from Montgomery County in Virginia,
        define a suitable population.

      \item  If the values represent the number of tickets issued by a random
        sample of 8 state troopers from South Carolina, define a suitable
        population.

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Let \(X_1, X_2,\ldots,X_n\) are a random sample of size \(n\). Classify
    each of the following as a statistics or not a statistic.
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{X_i - \mu }{\sigma} \right)^2 \)

      \item \(\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| X_i - \bar{X} \right|  \)

  \item \textbf{8.2} The lengths of time, in minutes, that 10 patients waited
    in a doctorâ€™s office before receiving treatment were recorded as follows:
    5, 11, 9, 5, 10, 15, 6, 10, 5, and 10. Treating the data as a random
    sample, find
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item the mean;
      \item the median;
      \item the mode.

  \item \textbf{8.3} The reaction times for a random sample of 9 subjects to a
    stimulant were recorded as 2.5, 3.6, 3.1, 4.3, 2.9. 2.3, 2.6, 4.1, and 3.4
    seconds. Calculate:
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item the mean;
      \item the median.

    \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{8.10} For the sample of reaction times in Exercise 8.3,
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item the range;
      \item the standard deviation.

    \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{8.11} For the data of Exercise 8.5, calculate the variance using the formula
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item using form (8.2.1),
        \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
            S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( X_i - \bar{X} \right)^2
        \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

      \item using theorem 8.1,
        \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
            S^2 = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \left[ n \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i^2 - \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right)^2  \right]
        \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item \textbf{8.23} The random variable X, representing the number of cherries in a
    cherry puff, has the following probability distribution:
    \begin{table}[h]

      \caption{caption}
      \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
        x & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
        \midrule
        P(X = x) & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\
      \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Find the mean \(\mu\) and the variance \(\sigma^2\) of \(X\).
      \item Find the mean \(\mu_{\bar{X}} \) and the variance
        \(\sigma^2_{\bar{X}} \) of the mean \(\bar{X}\) for random samples of
        36 cherry puffs.
      \item Find the probability that the average number of cherries in 36
        cherry puffs will be less than 5.5.

    \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{8.25} The average life of a bread-making machine is 7 years,
    with a standard deviation of 1 year. Assuming that the lives of these
    machines follow approximately a normal distribution, find
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item the probability that the mean life of a random sample of 9 such
        machines falls between 6.4 and 7.2 years;

      \item the value of x to the right of which 15\% of the means computed
        from random samples of size 9

    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{8.27} In a chemical process, the amount of a certain type of
      impurity in the output is difficult to control and is thus a random
      variable. Speculation is that the population mean amount of the impurity
      is 0.20 gram per gram of output. It is known that the standard deviation
      is 0.1 gram per gram. An experiment is conducted to gain more insight
      regarding the speculation that \(\mu = 0.2\)

      The process is run on a lab scale 50 times and the sample average \(\bar{x}\)
      turns out to be 0.23 gram per gram. Comment on the speculation that the
      mean amount of impurity is 0.20 gram per gram. Make use of the Central
      Limit Theorem in your work.

    \item \textbf{8.33} The chemical benzene is highly toxic to humans. However, it is
    used in the manufacture of many medicine dyes, leather, and coverings.
    Government regulations dictate that for any production process involving
    benzene, the water in the output of the process must not exceed 7950 parts
    per million (ppm) of benzene. For a particular process of concern, the
    water sample was collected by a manufacturer 25 times randomly and the
    sample average \(\bar{x}\) was 7960 ppm. It is known from historical data that the
    standard deviation \(\sigma\) is 100 ppm.
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item What is the probability that the sample average in this experiment
        would exceed the government limit if the population mean is equal to
        the limit? Use the Central Limit Theorem.

      \item Is an observed \(\bar{x}\) = 7960 in this experiment firm evidence
        that the population mean for the process exceeds the government limit?
        Answer your question by computing
        \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        P(\bar{X} \geq 7960 | \mu = 7950)
      \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      Assume that the distribution of benzene concentration is normal.

  \item \textbf{8.49} A normal population with unknown variance has a mean of
    20. Is one likely to obtain a random sample of size 9 from this population
    with a mean of 24 and a standard deviation of 4.1? If not, what conclusion
    would you draw?

  \item 8.50 A maker of a certain brand of low-fat cereal bars claims that the
    average saturated fat content is 0.5 gram. In a random sample of 8 cereal
    bars of this brand, the saturated fat content was 0.6, 0.7, 0.7, 0.3, 0.4,
    0.5, 0.4, and 0.2. Would you agree with the claim? Assume a normal
    distribution.

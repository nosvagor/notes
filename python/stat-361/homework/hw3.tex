  \item (2.85) The probability that a doctor correctly diagnoses a particular
    illness is 0.7. Given that the doctor makes an incorrect diagnosis, the
    probability that the patient files a lawsuit is 0.9. What is the probability that the doctor makes an incorrect diagnosis and
    the patient sues?

  \item (2.89) A town has two fire engines operating independently. The
    probability that a specific engine is available when needed is 0.96.

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item What is the probability that neither is available when needed?

  \item (2.109) A large industrial firm uses three local motels to provide
    overnight accommodations for its clients. From past experience it is known
    that 20\% of the clients are assigned rooms at the Ramada Inn, 50\% at the
    Sheraton, and 30\% at the Lakeview Motor Lodge. If the plumbing is faulty
    in 5\% of the rooms at the Ramada Inn, in 4\% of the rooms at the Sheraton,
    and in 8\% of the rooms at the Lakeview Motor Lodge, what is the
    probability that
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item a client will be assigned a room with faulty plumbing?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item

        \end{itemize}

      \item a person with a room having faulty plumbing was assigned
        accommodations at the Lakeview Motor Lodge?

  \item (2.113) From a box containing 6 black balls and 4 green balls, 3 balls
    are drawn in succession, each ball being re- placed in the box before the
    next draw is made. What is the probability that
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item all 3 are the same color?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item

  \item (3.1) Classify the following random variables as discrete or
    continuous:

          \item

        \end{itemize}
      \item M: the amount of milk produced yearly by a particular cow.

  \item (3.3) Let \(W\) be a random variable giving the number of heads minus the
    number of tails in three tosses of a coin. List the elements of the sample
    space \(S\) for the three tosses of the coin and to each sample point assign a
    value \(w\) of \(W\).

  \item (3.35) Suppose it is known from large amounts of historical data that
    X, the number of cars that arrive at a specific intersection during a
    20 second time period, is characterized by the following discrete
    probability function:
    \[%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
      f(x) = e^{-6}\frac{6^x}{x!}, \forall x \in \Z^+
    \]%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Find the probability that in a specific 20 second
        time period, more than 8 cars arrive at the intersection.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item

% If you're using LaTeX read this first.
% You'll find the following two things helpful.
%
% First look up graphviz to draw graphs.
% Graphviz is a really useful tool regardless.
%
% To use it, make a .dot file for the graph
% like house.dot
% in the file the syntax is:
% graph house {
%    v1 -- v2;
%    v1 -- v3;
%    v2 -- v3;
%    v2 -- v4;
%    v3 -- v5;
%    v4 -- v5;
% }
% This will draw the how graph.
% you're just listing the edges.
% then you can run

% > dot -Tpng house.dot > house.png
% That is run the dot command
% The file type (-T) is .png
% the graph is house.dot
% then write it to house.png
% Then you can include it in latex with \includegraphics{house}
%
% There are a whole bunch of attributes that you can set
% for nodes and edges.
%
% if you want to draw the graphs yourself in latex, you can use tikz
% This is harder, because you have to specify where the nodes are,
% but it's still doable
% here's the house graph in tikz
% \def\house{
% \begin{tikzpicture}
%     \def\a{(1,2)}
%     \def\b{(0,1)}
%     \def\c{(2,1)}
%     \def\d{(0,0)}
%     \def\e{(2,0)}
%     \fill \a circle (2pt);
%     \fill \b circle (2pt);
%     \fill \c circle (2pt);
%     \fill \d circle (2pt);
%     \fill \e circle (2pt);
%     \draw \a -- \b;
%     \draw \b -- \c;
%     \draw \c -- \a;
%     \draw \b -- \d;
%     \draw \c -- \e;
%     \draw \d -- \e;
% \end{tikzpicture}}
%
% Trees are much easier
% you can use the qtree package
% You define a tree with \Tree[.name subtrees ]
% the tree
%      1
%    2   3
%   4 5 6 7
% is
% \Tree[.1 [.2 4 5 ] [.3 6 7 ] ]
% important notes: leafs don't need to have brackets or a . in front of them.
% You NEED a space before ANY closing brackets.
% I'm serious, it will break if you don't.

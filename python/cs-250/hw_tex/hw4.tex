  \item Prove that \(n^2 \neq 2 \bmod 3, \quad \forall n \in \Z \)

  \item Fermatâ€™s Last theorem is a famous theorem in Math that was unproven for
    200 years. The theorem says \(\forall n > 2,~ a,b,c \in \N \then  a^n +
    b^n \neq c^n\). Another way to state this is \(a^n + b^n = c^n\) has no integer
    solutions for $n$ larger than 2. Use this theorem to prove that \(\sqrt[n]{2}\) is
    irrational for $n$ larger than 2.
    \begin{align*}
      \sqrt[n]{2} \in \Q &\then \exists a,b \in \Z : \gcd{(a,b)}=1 \\
                         &\then a^n = 2b^n \then a^n = b^n + b^n
    \end{align*}
    Thus, this contradicts Fermat's Last theorem implying \(\sqrt[n]{2}\) is
    irrational for \(n > 2\).

      \link{https://math.stackexchange.com/q/783392}{zscoder's proof}. No real
      credit here; I couldn't figure it out myself at first. It's pretty simple
      though, so I couldn't formulate something else that was better without
      adding unnecessary steps (originally completed in hw3)}.

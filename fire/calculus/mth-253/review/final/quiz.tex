\begin{enumerate}
  \item For each statement below, indicate whether it is \textbf{True} or
    \textbf{False} and provide a brief justification.

  \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=24em]
    \item The series \(\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \cos
      \left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \) converges.

    \item If the radius of converges of the power series \(\displaystyle
      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_nx^n \) is \(R=5\), then the series must converge
      for \(x = -3\) and \(x = -4\).

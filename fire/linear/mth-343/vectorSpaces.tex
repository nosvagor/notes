  \subsection{Problems 25, 26, 30, 31}
  \begin{itemize}
    \minor{\item[25.] If we add an extra column \tbm{b} to a matrix \tbm{A},
      then the column space gets larger unless \aset{<?>}.

      \item Give an example in which the column space gets larger and an example in
        which it doesn't.

      \item Why is Ax = b solvable exactly when the column space doesn't get larger
      by including b?}

      \minor{\item[26.] The columns of \tbm{AB} are combinations of the columns
      of \tbm{A}. This means: the column space of \tbm{AB} contained in
      (possibly equal to) the column space of \tbm{A}. Give an example where the
      column spaces of \tbm{A} and \tbm{AB} are not equal.}

      \minor{\item[30.] If the \(9 \times 12\) system \(\bm{Ax} = \bm{b}\) is
      solvable for every \tbm{b}, then \aset{\(C(A) =\)}}.

      \minor{\item[31.] Why isn't \(\R^2\) a subspace of \(\R^3\)?}

  \subsection{Problems 12, 24, 25, 70}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \minor{\item[12.] Which of these rules give a correct definition of the
    rank of \tbm{A}?
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The number of nonzero rows in \tbm{R}.
      \item The number of columns minus the total number of rows.
      \item The number of columns minus the number of free columns.
      \item The number of 1s in \tbm{R}.
    \end{enumerate}}

    \minor{\item[24.] Every column of \tbm{AB} is a combination of the columns
    of \tbm{A}. Then the dimensions of the column spaces give \(\rank{\bm{AB}}
    \leq \rank{ \bm{A} }\).

    Problem: Prove also that \(\rank{\bm{AB}} \leq \rank{ \bm{B} }\).}

    \minor{\item[25.] (Important) Suppose \tbm{A} and \tbm{B} are \(n \times
    n\) matrices, and \tbm{AB} = \tbm{I}. Prove from \(\rank{ AB } \leq
    \rank{ A }\) that the rank of \tbm{A} is n. So A is invertible and \tbm{B}
    must be its two-sided inverse. Therefore \(\bm{BA} = \bm{I}\)}

    \minor{\item[70.] Explain why \tbm{A} and \(-\bm{A}\) always have the same
    reduced echelon form \tbm{R}.}

      vectors in \(\R^3\).
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item There four vectors are dependent because \aset{<?>}
        \item The two vectors \(\bm{v}_1\) and \(\bm{v}_2\) will be dependent
          if \aset{<?>}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If the columns of a matrix are dependent, so are the rows.
      \item The column space of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix is the same as its row space.
      \item The column space of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix has the same dimension as its row space.
      \item The columns of a matrix are a basis for the column space.
    \end{enumerate}

  \minor{\item[36.] If \tbm{A} is a \(64 \times 17\) matrix of rank 11, how

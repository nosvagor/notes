\section{1.2 The Geometry of Linear Equations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item []

  \subsection{Problems 1--12}
  \begin{enumerate}\color{foreground-2}
    \item For the equations \( x + y = 4, ~ 2x - 2y = 4 \), draw the row picture (two
      intersecting lines) and the column picture (combination of two columns
      equal to the column vector (4,4) on the right side).

      \begin{figure}[ht]
          \centering
          \incfig[1]{1.2.1}
          \caption{1.2.1}
      \end{figure}

    \item Solve to find a combination of the columns that equals \(b\):
      \begin{align*}
        u - v - w &= b_1 \\
        v + w &= b_2 \\
        w &= b_3
      \end{align*}
      \vspace{-35pt}
      \fg{\begin{align*}
        &\then w = b_3 \\
        &\then v = b_2 - b_3 \\
        &\then u = b_1 + v + w = b_1 + b_2
      \end{align*}}
      \vspace{-18pt}

    \item Describe the intersection of the three planes \(  u+v+w+z = 6 \) and
      \( u+w+z = 4 \) and \( u+w = 2 \) (all in four-dimensional space). Is it
      a line or a point or an empty set? What is the intersection if the fourth
      plane \( u = -1 \) is included? Find a fourth equation that leaves us
      with no solution.
      \begin{itemize}\color{foreground}
        \item \aset{A line}; as \( u + w = 2 \) is only a line (*?). A fourth plane
          with \( u = -1 \) would produce a normally intersecting point. Any
          addition equation when \( u + w \neq 2 \) would produce an
          inconsistent equation.
      \end{itemize}


    \item Sketch these three lines and decide if the equations are solvable:
      \begin{align*}
        x + 2y &= 2 \\
        x - y &= 2 \\
        y &= 1
      \end{align*}
      \vspace{-30pt}
      \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \incfig[1]{1.2.4}
        \caption{1.2.4}
      \end{figure}

      What happens if all right-hand sides are zero? Is there any nonzero
      choice of right-hand sides that allows the three lines to intersect at
      the same point?
      \begin{itemize}\color{foreground}
        \item If all the solutions were zero, then it would be a trivial
          solution.
        \item Yes, e.g., \( x - y = -1 \) would produce a single point of
          intersection.
      \end{itemize}

    \item Find two points on the line of intersection of the three planes \( t
      = 0 \) and \( z = 0 \) and \( x+y+z+t = 1 \) in four-dimensional space.

     \fg{\[
        \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \qquad
        \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0  \end{bmatrix}
     \]}

    \item When \( b = (2,5,7) \), find a solution \( (u,v,w) \) to equation (4)
      different from the solution \( (1,0,1) \) mentioned in the text.
      \begin{itemize}\color{foreground}
        \item Since there are infinite solutions, and if \tbm{s} vector
          describing one solution and \( \lambda \) is any scalar, then \(
          \bm{s} \lambda \) is also a solution. E.g., \( \left( 1,0,1 \right)
          42 = \left( 42,0,42 \right)  \)
      \end{itemize}


    \item Give two more right-hand sides in addition to \( b = (2,5,7) \) for which equation (4) can be solved. Give two more right-hand sides in addition to
      \( b = (2,5,6) \)  for which it cannot be solved.

    \item Explain why the system
      \begin{align*}
        u + v + w &= 2 \\
        u + 2v + 3w &= 1 \\
        v + 2w &= 0
      \end{align*}
      is singular by finding a combination of the three equations that adds up
      to \(0 = 1\). What value should replace the last zero on the right side to
      allow the equations to have solutions---and what is one of the solutions?
      \fg{\begin{align*}
      \begin{bmatrix}[ccc|c]
        1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
        1 & 2 & 3 & 1 \\
        0 & 1 & 2 & 0
      \end{bmatrix}
      \xRightarrow{R_2 - R_1}
      \begin{bmatrix}[ccc|c]
        1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
        0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\
        0 & 1 & 2 & 0
      \end{bmatrix}
      \xRightarrow{R_3-R_2}
      \begin{bmatrix}[ccc|c]
        1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
        0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}
      \end{align*}}
      \begin{itemize}\color{foreground}
        \item Replacing the last zero with \aset{\( -1 \)} would yield infinite
          solutions. One solution would be \( \left[ 3,-1,0 \right]^T \)
      \end{itemize}

    \item The column picture for the previous exercise (singular system) is
      \begin{align*}
        u \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} +
        v \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} +
        w \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = b
      \end{align*}
      Show that the three columns on the left lie in the same plane by
      expressing the third as a combination of the first two. What are all the
      solutions \( (u,v,w) \) if \(b\) is the zero vector \( (0,0,0) \)?
      \fg{\begin{align*}
        -1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} +
        2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} =
        \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
      \end{align*}}
      \begin{itemize}\color{foreground}
        \item If is \tbm{b} equal to the zero vector \nil then the solutions
          are equal to the kernel (*?) i.e., \( -1x_1, 2x_2, 0x_3  = \nil\)
      \end{itemize}

    \item Under what condition on \( y_1, y_2, y_3 \) do the points \((0,y_1),
      (1,y_2), (2,y_3)\) lie on a straight line?
      \begin{itemize}\color{foreground}
        \item Question 9 describes the state at which they are co linear, i.e.,
          \( y_3 = 2y_2 - y_1 \)
      \end{itemize}


    \item These equations are certain to have the solution \( x = y = 0 \). For which
      values of \(a\) is there a whole line of solutions?
      \begin{align*}
        ax + 2y = 0 \\
        2x + ay = 0
      \end{align*}

    \item Starting with \( x+4y = 7 \), find the equation for the parallel line
      through \( x = 0, y = 0 \).
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Problems 13--15}
  \begin{enumerate}[resume]\color{foreground-2}
    \item  Draw the two pictures in two planes for the equations \( x-2y = 0, x+y
      = 6 \).

    \item For two linear equations in three unknowns \( x, y, z \), the row picture
      will show (2 or 3) (lines or planes) in (two or three)-dimensional space.
      The column picture is in (two or three)-dimensional space. The column
      picture is in (two or three)-dimensional space. The solutions
      normally lie on a <?>.

    \item For four linear equations in two unknowns \(x\) and \(y\), the row picture
      shows four <?>. The column picture is in <?>-dimensional space. The equations
      have no solution unless the vector on the right-hand side is a
      combination of <?>.
  \end{enumerate}


  \subsection{Problems 16--23}
  \begin{enumerate}[resume]\color{foreground-2}
    \item Find a point with \( z = 2 \) on the intersection line of the planes \( x + y
      + 3z = 6 \) and \( x-y+z = 4\). Find the point with \( z = 0\) and a third point
      halfway between.

    \item The first of these equations plus the second equals the third:
      \begin{align*}
        x + y + z &= 2 \\
        x + 2y + z &= 3 \\
        2x + 3y + 2z &= 5
      \end{align*}

      The first two planes meet along a line. The third plane contains that
      line, because if \( x, y, z \) satisfy the first two equations then they
      also <?>. The equations have infinitely many solutions (the whole line \tbm{L}). Find
      three solutions.

    \item Move the third plane in Problem 17 to a parallel plane \( 2x + 3y + 2z =
      9 \). Now the three equations have no solution---\textit{why not}? The first two planes
      meet along the line \tbm{L}, but the third plane doesn't that line.

    \item In Problem 17 the columns are \( (1,1,2) \) and \( (1,2,3) \) and \(
      (1,1,2) \). This is a ``singular case'' because the third column is <?>.
      Find two combinations of the columns that give \( b = (2,3,5) \). This is
      only possible for \( b = (4,6,c) \) if \(c = \)

    \item Normally 4 ``planes'' in four-dimensional space meet at a <?>. Normally 4
      column vectors in four-dimensional space can combine to produce \(b\). What
      combination of \( (1,0,0,0), (1,1,0,0), (1,1,1,0), (1,1,1,1) \) produces \(b =
      (3,3,3,2)\)? What 4 equations for \(x, y, z, t\) are you solving?

    \item When equation 1 is added to equation 2, which of these are changed:
      the planes in the row picture, the column picture, the coefficient
      matrix, the solution?

    \item  If \((a,b)\) is a multiple of \((c,d)\) with \(abcd \neq 0\), show
      that \((a,c)\) is a multiple of \((b,d)\). This is surprisingly
      important: call it a challenge question. You could use numbers first to
      see how \(a, b, c\), and \(d\) are related. The question will lead to:
      <?>

      If \(A = \begin{bsmallmatrix*} a && b \\ c && d\end{bsmallmatrix*}\)  has
        dependent rows then it has dependent columns.

      \item In these equations, the third column (multiplying w) is the same as
        the right side \(b\). The column form of the equations immediately
        gives what solution for \((u,v,w)\)?
        \begin{align*}
          6u + 7v + 8w &= 8 \\
          4u + 5v + 9w &= 9 \\
          2u - 2v + 7w &= 7
        \end{align*}

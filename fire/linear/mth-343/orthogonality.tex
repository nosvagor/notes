  \subsection{Projection Proof (class problem)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If I recall the problem correctly, we were requested to \aset{prove what
      \(\proj{v}{w}\) is equal to}.

    \item In my notes I have that a orthogonal projection occurs when the dot
      product between \tbm{v} and distance \tbm{w} from \tbm{v} is equal to
      zero. This follows from the definition of the inner product, i.e.,
      \[%%%%%%%%%%
      \lambda = \bm{v}^T \bm{w} = \norm{v} \norm{w} \cos \theta
      \]%%%%%%%%%%
    \item If \(\theta = 90^\circ\), then the vectors are perpendicular, i.e.,
      orthogonal. What we are missing is \aset{the distance} from \tbm{w} to
      \tbm{v}; the distance that yields an inner product of zero with a
      normalized \tbm{v} \aset{\textit{is the projection}}.
    \item This means we need a scaled version of \tbm{v}, let's call it
      \(\bm{v}\beta\), at which such inner product is equal to zero. At this
      point, the difference between \tbm{w} and \(\bm{v}\beta\) is exactly what
      we need in order to solve for a \(\beta\) that maintains an inner
      product of zero with the original vector \tbm{v}, i.e.,
      \begin{align*}
        \bm{v}^T (\bm{w}-\bm{v}\beta) &= 0 \\
        \bm{v}^T\bm{w}-\bm{v}^T \bm{v}\beta &= 0 \\
        \bm{v}^T \bm{v}\beta &= \bm{v}^T\bm{w} \\
        \beta &= \frac{\bm{v}^T\bm{w}}{\bm{v}^T \bm{v}}\\\\
        \then
        \proj{v}{w} = \bm{v}\beta &= \bm{v}\frac{\bm{v}^T\bm{w}}{\bm{v}^T \bm{v}}
      \end{align*}
    \item I've internalized this as a mapping of \tbm{w} onto
      \tbm{v} over a magnitude (the norm) of \tbm{v}.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The mapping is important because it tells us the shortest
          distance from \tbm{w} onto \tbm{v}, i.e., when they are orthogonal.
        \item The magnitude is important, because it is the basis at which
          \tbm{w} is parallel to \tbm{v}, which when added mapping distance,
          yields \tbm{w}.

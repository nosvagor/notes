#### Introduction

I, admittedly, am probably not using this repository as it's intended to be
used. I'm taking steps to hopefully create a collaborative workflow of some
kind that could enable others to work with me, but I doubt anything of the
sorts will actually happen. Regardless, I definitely leverage the psychological
motivation that GitHub's contribution tracker provides, so I have continued to
attempt to push most learning related tasks here.

I'm somewhat enamored with, or rather, persuaded by David Deutsch's arguments
from his books [_The Fabric of
Reality_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabric_of_Reality) and [_The
Beginning of
Infinity_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity), so I have
incorporated a architectural scheme to organize my interests that plays on the
four strands from his first book, a favorite show of mine, and a nod to
ancient philosophy in general.

Most previous learning of mine was centered around biology (my first
bachelor's), some of that content can and be found in [an archived
version](https://github.com/nosvagor/notes-old) of this repository. I intend to
revisit subjects in philosophy and biology in greater depth, but for now my
interest is elsewhere; most content will probably be computer science
and math related for the foreseeable future.

Each directory has a more elaborate README for navigational purposes. Listed
below will be links to directories containing relevant content based on where
my current focus is. If it proves useful, then please use, redistribute, or do
what ever you want with anything pushed here.
